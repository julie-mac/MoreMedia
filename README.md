  ## Description

  More is a back-end social media application using a MongoDB database for users to post their thoughts, as well as react to other users' thoughts. You can create new Thoughts, edit or delete them, add Reactions, edit or delete those as well, and add or delete friends. You can also look up the Users and see their thoughts.
  
  ## Installation
  
  First, clone the repository to your local machine. Then install the npm packages, Mongoose and Express via the command line by typing "npm install". You'll also want to install some kind of interface to test the server routes, such as Insomnia or Postman.

  ## Usage
  
  To start the server, type "npx nodemon server.js" into the terminal.
  Once you've started the server, test out the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints via Insomnia (or other interface) to view, add to or update the database.
